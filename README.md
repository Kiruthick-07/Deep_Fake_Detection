# Deep Fake Detection

This project is a web-based application designed to detect deep fake images. It allows users to upload images and processes them to identify whether they are authentic or manipulated. The application uses a machine learning model for detection and is built with a combination of frontend and backend technologies.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images for analysis.
- **Deep Fake Detection:** The application uses a trained machine learning model to detect deep fake images.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is mobile-friendly with a responsive menu.
- **Backend Integration:** The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database.
- **Secure Connection:** Environment variables are used to secure sensitive information like database credentials.
